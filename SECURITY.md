# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of my projects, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email: ehehwnwjs5052@gmail.com

Include:
- Affected repository and version
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)

You will receive a response within 48 hours acknowledging the report.

## General Scope

This policy applies to all public repositories owned by [@mason5052](https://github.com/mason5052). Individual repositories may have their own SECURITY.md with more specific policies.
